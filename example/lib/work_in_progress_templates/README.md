# Work in progress templates

Those files are the templates of classes the Framy generator creates.

We have them here in order to easily compile and hot reload the templates without need of re-generating them. It is also much easier to work on actual dart classes than String generators.

Every change made here should be reflected in changes in the actual Framy generator.
